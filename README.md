In this article, we are going to study the effect of more variables on measure of the fitness.

##Accuracy of the Model
Accuracy of the model is related to the standard errors, R2 and Residual Standard Error and F Statistics. a related table is shown here:

Remember that RSE and RSS were calculated like this:

RSE depends on the units of Y. For example here RSE of 3.26, in thousand units will be 3,260 units, which implies that actual sales (Y) might deviate from the estimated one by 3,260 units. 

R^2 tries to unit free, and it is the measure of the explained error over total error. It is calculated like this:
